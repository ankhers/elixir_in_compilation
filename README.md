This repository is here to test compilation of large literals with elixir's `in` macro.

I have two output files here.

* compilation.log - This file was generated by `touch`ing each individual file and running `mix compile --profile time`
* full_compilation.log - This file was generated by using `mix compile --force --profile time`
